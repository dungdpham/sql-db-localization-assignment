This solution utilizes Table-based localization. 3 "employee" tables were created with only the difference in localized language name ("employee_en", "employee_fa", and "employee_ja"), which are used to store the data input by user for the selected language in the app. The auto-increment ID is the only primary key in each table, which is needed to identified a specific "employee" (a row in the tables). To successfully localize the employee information into the database, the user will need to enter information of the same employee in every language (English, Farsi, and Japanese) at one go in order to get the correct ID across tables for that employee.

The UI was made by modifying the hello-view.fxml and HelloController.java, which were created by default upon initializing a new JavaFX project. The value returned by the language selector drop-down list (ComboBox element) determines the correct table to which the current inputs will be inserted into. JDBC driver was declared as a dependency in the pom.xml file to establish connection to MariaDB server.
