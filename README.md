This solution utilizes Table-based localization. 3 "employee" tables were created with only the difference in localized language name ("employee_en", "employee_fa", and "employee_ja"), which are used to store the data input by the user for the selected language in the app. The employee ID is the only primary key in each table, which is used to identified a specific "employee" (row) in the table. To successfully localize the employee information into the database, the user will need to enter the information of the same employee in every language (English, Farsi, Japanese) at once in order to get the correct employee across tables for that employee.
